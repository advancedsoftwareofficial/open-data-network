# Open Data Network by Advanced Software

Today we have so many systems that talks to each other and want to exchange data. The main problem we have that the way we exchange data. We need to open an API or GraphQL or OData endpoints to share and exchange data. This is a time consuming process and takes a lot to create and maintain.

Our mission in the Open Data Network is enable data exchange between different parties in cheap, secure, fast and easy way.

This proposal and white paper are a suggestion and might be changed over time but without breaking the network.

Network main components:
Sender
Receiver
Exchange Message
Data Store
Exchange Token (Cypto)
Permissions

We are propsing to exchange data via asymmetric encryption. The sender and reciever identities are concealed via address similar to crypto wallets addresses.

The parties of the network can exchange data either via network or P2P. We never decrypt or see the data sent no matter what type.

Anyone can signup for the network to have their data stored no matter what their type either individual or
